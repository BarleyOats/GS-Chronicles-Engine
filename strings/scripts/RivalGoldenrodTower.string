Allow me to introduce myself.\nMy name's Aspryus. I'm sure\lyou don't remember my face.\pIt's been a long time since I\nlast visited New Bark Town.\lYour mother and I used to be\lfriends long time ago.\pI came to visit my own company\nbecause Professor Oak invited\lan old friend to record his\lradio show today.\pProfessor Birch came from\nLittleroot Town of the Hoenn\lregion. He got interested when\lhe heard Professor Elm's\lassistants were coming.

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String4
Hello! Nice to meet you,\n[PLAYER]. Professor Oak told me\labout you and your work as\lProfessor Elm's assistant.\pYou do such an amazing job!

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String5
I heard you were coming to\nGoldenrod City so I asked you\lto come here to give you\lsomething that will help you\lcomplete your Pokédex faster!

Hi! I'm sorry for being late.\nI had to make some emergency\lpurchases at the mall.

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String9
Ah, it's you, dad[.] I didn't expect\nyou to be here.

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String10
Oh! It's my sweetie girl!\nYou don't look as excited as\lI am to see you again after\la very long time.\pI hope you already forgave me for "that" 

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String11
As I said before. Here are the\nreports of my personal research\labout Pok�mon breeding. I'd like\lyou to check it and if it's\lpossible, add more information\labout it. My grandparents helped\lme out a lot in this.

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String12
I'm sorry but I've to go.\nI just remembered Professor Elm\lasked me to help him with\lsomething else. I'm getting\llate for it. Maybe later we\lcan have time to talk.\pSee you[.]

I don't know what is wrong with\nher. She is usually so glad when\lshe sees me. Maybe she has a\lheadache. You know, being a kind\lof scientist might be stressful.

Oh! It's my little champ boy!\nYou don't look as excited as\lI am to see you again after\la very long time.

By the way, The main reason to\ninvite you to come was because\lI'm currently investing on our own\lPok�mon League so we don't have to\lgo to Kanto. I think having a\lProfessor Elm Assitant as a\lchallenger sounds like a great\lidea. Keep earning badges!\pWell. I also have to go.\nI'm supervising the building\lof our own Victory Road.\pTake care all of you!

[player], I was checking your\nPok�dex, and I'm impressed. You've\lbeen catching many kinds of\lPok�mon. I'm glad you're helping\lme a lot with the Pok�dex\lcompletion.\pI would like to stay in touch\nwith you. I see you have a\lPok�Gear. Let me register your\lPhone number.

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String20
Professor Oak's Phone number was\nregistered!

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String21
I see you're a reliable person\nso Professor Oak suggested me\lto give you a device developed\lby Devon Corp. called DexNav.\pDexNav is a device that helps\nyou to spot Pok�mon species\lyou've met before in the tall\lgrass and complete your\lPok�dex faster.\pIt was designed to work with a\nPok�nav, but we developed a\lPok�gear compatible version!

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String22
You got a DexNav card\ninserted in your Pok�gear!

#org @gText_RivalGoldenrodTower_String23
Be careful to not run when you\nselect a Pok�mon species or else\lthey will notice you and run.\p[.]\pRecording a radio show made me\nhungry. I'll take a break before\lI go back to Hoenn.\pI'll be in contact with Professor\nOak to get updates about the\lDexNav card I gave you.\pGood bye you two!
